                            I started in the Faculty of Science (majoring in Integrated Science) before transferring to LFS at the end of my second year majoring in Food, Nutrition and Health (general), and graduated just this past year. WIth my continued interest in student development, I decided to continue to support students and starting in August, I will be the Program Assistant at the Arts Co-op office at UBC.

                            Being able to incorporate my own student experience along with working to improve LFS 100 to better support students to be successful learners and feel empowered to make the most out of their undergraduate experience.

                            <strong><em>What is your biggest wish for first year students?</em></strong>

                            My biggest wish for first year students is that they build resilience and confidence in themselves to utilize all available resources and seek opportunities to reach their potential during their studies and beyond.

                            <strong><em>What has your academic journey been like?</em></strong>

                            I took a year off after high school and travelled, including spending some time on a farm in New Zealand.  I started first year in the Faculty of Arts, but transferred into the Global Resource Systems major in LFS in second year.  I graduated in 2018 and spent a year travelling and working on the LFS Redesign project.  In Fall 2019, I will begin the MD program at UBC.

                            <strong><em>What did you enjoy about working on LFS 100?</em></strong>

                            It was interesting to reflect on my own experiences in first year and have the opportunity to help make others’ transition to university easier.  I think it would have been useful to have these resources when I was a first-year student.  It was also interesting to reflect on how I’ve changed and developed since first year – and develop skills in video editing!

                            <strong><em>What is your biggest wish for first year students?</em></strong>

                            That they make their degree their own.  Don’t just do things to check them off a list, find what really interest you and make your degree unique to you.

                            </em></strong>

                            I began by studying political science where I was interested in how we measure political ideas such as "democracy, corruption, fairness." This led me into the field of measurement, where now I think about how we can quantify and evaluate many different type of ideas. But I remain heavily interested in how we can measure peoples' well-being in different contexts (political, educational, and other contexts).

                            <strong><em>What were your favourite courses?</em></strong>

                            My favourite courses were philosophy courses, such as theory of the mind, political geography, or social justice courses. These classes taught me how to think flexibly and creatively and to make connections between empirical research and larger systems of thinking.

                            <strong><em>What did you enjoy about working on LFS 100?</em></strong>

                            As a soon to be PhD graduate, I consider myself as an expert working within the field of "positive psychology". I am excited about the LFS 100 course as a way to help improve students' experiences at UBC in a way that is positively, transformative for their lives. Likewise, it has been a real joy to collaborate outside my typical discipline and to learn from my colleagues.

                            <strong><em>What is your biggest wish for first year students?</em></strong>

                            I hope that first-year students really savour the opportunity to sit with difficult ideas that cannot always be resolved. I consider this a practice of "contemplative thinking", which I believe supports our abilities to think not just critically, but also creatively. I wish first-year students to be courageous in experiencing and thinking in new ways that emboldens them to create new solutions/art/ideas.
