                                            <li>The condition of the book (e.g. writing, notes, highlighting, missing pages, etc)</li>
                                            <li>Edition of the book (double check you can use this one for your course)</li>
                                            <li>Their asking price (they may ask you to offer but if possible, ask them the price and it may be lower than you expected)</li>
                                            <li>Set up a specific date, time and location in a public area</li>
                                            <li>Exact cash (if you are selling or buying) to make the exchange easier</li>
                                            <li>Exchange an e-mail or phone number as you deem appropriate in case they need to contact you on the day of the exchange</li>

                                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Compare prices of other used books by searching the course and/or textbook name in any of the facebook group search bars to see what the approximate value is so you’re not being overcharged for the book</li>
                                            <li>Look early and message swiftly because the used textbooks can be bought very quickly</li>
                                            <li>You can try to offer a slightly lower price (e.g. asking for $50 and you offer $40 or $45) but beware if the book is popular or there aren’t many other sellers, that you may have to take it for the offer price</li>
                                            <li>Beware of interac-e transfers (mainly when you sell textbooks), cash is the easiest. Bring along change with you in case the buyer doesn’t have exact cash (but try to emphasize this in the initial conversation)</li>
                                            <li>There may be a chance that after agreeing with you to the exchange, that they back out due to another person paying more. In this case, consider the other facebook groups, Discount Textbooks and UBC Bookstore.</li>

Students pay $41/month that they are in school as part of the school fees which are mandatory (ie. if you’re not taking summer classes, you don’t get the discount) compared to $174/month.</li>
                                    <li>You can buy a Compass Card ($6 deposit) at the UBC Bookstore or Shoppers Drug Mart or<a href="https://www.translink.ca/Fares-and-Passes/Where-to-buy-FareDealer.aspx"> other locations near you</a>.</li>
                                    <li>You will need to bring your student ID with you when you use the transit system to prove you are in the U-Pass program.</li>

                                            <li>It may be a bit weird to have to reload it every month but that is how monthly passes are processed onto your Compass Card whether you are a part of the U-Pass program or not.</li>

                                    <li>You may think about graduating as quickly as possible but consider enriching your experience on-campus, in the community or internationally. You never know where you will discover your passion and you can learn valuable and transferable skills along the way! It is quite common to graduate in 5 years now because a lot of students are <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/go-global">studying abroad</a>, doing <a href="https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/prospective/apply/land">Science co-op</a>, <a href="https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/undergraduate/classroom/guided-independent-learning-opportunities/">guided independent learning opportunities</a>, and other opportunities to gain experience. These experiences will also make you more confident and more competitive in the job market once you graduate so think about how you would like to enrich your experience and talk to an Academic Advisor at <a href="https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/student-services/">LFS Student Services</a> if you need some advice.</li>

                                        There are a variety of resources you can use but there are a few things you need to figure out first:

                                            <li>What is it that you are struggling with specifically? Is it one concept, a chapter, assignment, application-based questions, concept questions. Spend some time to figure this out.</li>
                                            <li>See what resources are available for the course and field. Drop by instructor office hours and/or teaching assistants. Is there a learning centre available (e.g. <a href="https://science.ubc.ca/students/resources/learning">Chem Resource Centre</a>, <a href="https://www.botany.ubc.ca/facilities/biology-learning-centre">Biology Resource Centre</a>, <a href="https://physsoc.phas.ubc.ca/academic/free-tutoring/">Physics Help Centre</a>, and <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~MLC/">Math Learning Centre </a>are a few examples)?</li>

BUT... if it is one assignment, it is actually a lot smaller than you think. For anything that requires looking a transcript, they don’t see how you did on each assessment in the course, they only see the final grade. If you do poorly in one class, it is not the end of the world but think about how you can improve for the future. If there are patterns showing such as multiple failing grades each and every year, then that can indicate a bigger problem. What you want to show is that although you did poorly in a class or may even have failed a class, how can you bounce back and talk about this as a learning experience? This will also help you build resilience and take failure as learning moments.</li>

                                I am writing because I want to clarify the midterm exam in CHEM 121 (section 003). I wanted to ask if you are available during your office hours this week or at another time to review question #3 in the short answer section along with study strategies and how to do better next time.
