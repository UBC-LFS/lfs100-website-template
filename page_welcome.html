            One of the primary tasks (and pleasures!) for a scholar of any field or discipline is to carefully examine an idea, a question, a hypothesis, or a challenge, and to emerge from that quest with a richer and more profound sense of its significance, value, context(s), and/or consequence. Most of the time you will not know where that journey will take you; indeed, you will very likely be surprised along the way!
            This assignment requires you to produce a wiki entry on a specified city and course theme. You may choose a case study within any city of your choice, but you may NOT choose the city or theme indicated as the regional focus given by me. You can choose the same city as a previous group but not the same theme; you may choose the same theme as another group but in a different city This activity is an important opportunity for you to participate in creating part of your own curriculum. All of the wiki entries will be complied into an e-book at the end of the course, which you will all have access to as evidence of your hard work!
            Task: During the second week of class you will be divided into groups of 4 based on your interest in one of the topics covered by the course. You are expected to meet with your group on a regular basis (part of the second weekly lecture will be dedicated to this) in formulating your case study wiki.

            OPEN CASE STUDIES AT UBC
            This project brings together faculty and students from across departments and Faculties to co-create an interdisciplinary, open educational resource with case studies that can be used by anyone, at UBC or elsewhere. Many of these case studies focus on topics in sustainability, but we also include cases on other topics that benefit from an interdisciplinary approach. The cases on this site are open educational resources: they have an open license to allow for revision and reuse of the cases in other courses and contexts (the cases are licensed CC BY 4.0). If you would like to know how you might use these cases in your own course, please see our Teaching Guide, as well as our guide on how to use this website.        
            We are looking to expand this resource by finding more courses in which students and faculty might use and revise these case studies, or even create new case studies to be included in the collection. If you think you might be interested, please see information on how to get involved!
