            The Faculty of Land and Food Systems (LFS) (formerly Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, formerly Faculty of Agriculture) is one of the three founding Faculties at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
            The faculty's administrative home is the H.R. MacMillan Building, with other programs housed across the UBC Point Grey campus, and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia.
            The faculty's academic and research programs focus on the relationships between land, food, and natural resource use, both at a local level, and within a global context. The faculty is also home to the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm, the only remaining working farm in the City of Vancouver. Research by faculty and students covers a breadth of subjects, including soil, water and air use, food security, nutrition, food safety, food economics, agriculture, viticulture, animal welfare, food microbiology and aquaculture.            
            The faculty awards a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) for all undergraduate programs, and Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Food Science (MFS), Master of Food and Resource Economics (MFRE), and Doctorate (Ph.D.) at the graduate level.
