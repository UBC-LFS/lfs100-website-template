      You can learn to solve a differential equation.  You can learn to ride a bike.  But is happiness something that can be learned?  And if so, how?  This class section will introduce the fundamental philosophical puzzle of God and the Good Life and discuss Aristotle's answer to it.  We will also talk about the structure of our course and what to expect this semester.
      These activities will help you prepare for our first class meeting.  At least one day before each class, you should work through the Read This, Watch This, and Do This sections.  Read anything not marked OPTIONAL.  Pay attention to deadlines.  You can always view complete assignment lists on the Policies & Calendar page.
      Key Concepts: Virtue, Eudaimonia, the Doctrine of the Mean, Habit
